            <p> Chicken tikka is believed to have originated in 
                the South-Asian <br>continent and is a popular dish
                especially in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
            </p>

                of meat that are on skewers. <br><em>Masala</em> refers

            <h2>Steps for Preparing</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; 
                        <br> let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).  
                    </li>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <li>
                        Heat oil in a large skillet or pot overmedium-high heat. When sizzling, add 
                        <br>chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. 
                        <br>Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. 
                        <br>(You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)  
                    </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <li>
                        Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes)
                        <br>while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.  
                    </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <li>
                        Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala,
                        <br>cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, 
                        <br>while stirring occasionally.
                    </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <li>
                        Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, 
                        <br>stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour
                    </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <li>
                        Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into 
                        <br>the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through 
                        <br>and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.
                    </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <li>
                        Garnish with coriander and serve with hot vegetable rice 
                        <br>or fresh homemade butter naan bread or mashed potatoes
